### Get Config
Get value of one config item following priority:

* Step 1 - Get from local cache with timestamp, if the cache value was expired, get from following sources and update local cache.
* Step 2 - Get from local failover dir(default: `${cwd}/acm/data`).
  * Failover dir can be manually copied from snapshot dir(default: `${cwd}/acm/snapshot`) in advance.
  * This helps to suppress the effect of known server failure.
* Step 3 - Get from one server until value is got or all servers tried.
  * Content will be save to snapshot dir after got from server.
* Step 4 - Get from snapshot dir.
